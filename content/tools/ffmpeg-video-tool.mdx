# FFmpeg Video Tool

A powerful browser-based video processing tool that runs FFmpeg entirely on your computer using WebAssembly. No uploads, no server processing - your videos stay private and secure.

## Features

### 📦 Format Conversion
Convert between popular video formats:
- **MP4** - Universal compatibility
- **WebM** - Web-optimized format
- **AVI** - Classic video format
- **MOV** - QuickTime format

### 🗜️ Compression & Quality
Optimize your videos for different use cases:
- **Compress for Web** - Balanced quality and file size for web publishing
- **High Quality** - Maximum quality with H.264 encoding
- **Small File Size** - Aggressive compression for minimal file size

### ✂️ Video Editing
Simple editing operations:
- **Resize** - Scale to 1080p, 720p, or 480p resolution
- **Rotate** - Rotate video 90 degrees clockwise
- **Trim** - Cut first 30 seconds of video

### 🔊 Audio Operations
Manage audio tracks:
- **Extract Audio** - Save audio as MP3
- **Remove Audio** - Create silent video
- **Boost/Lower Audio** - Adjust volume by ±6dB

## How It Works

This tool uses **FFmpeg.wasm**, a complete port of the FFmpeg multimedia framework to WebAssembly. All processing happens directly in your browser:

1. **Privacy First** - Your videos never leave your device
2. **No Upload Limits** - Process files up to 2GB (browser memory limit)
3. **First Use** - Downloads ~22MB FFmpeg library (cached for future use)
4. **Processing Time** - Expect 20-50x slower than desktop FFmpeg

## Usage Tips

### Performance Expectations

- **Small files (under 50MB)**: Processing takes 1-5 minutes
- **Medium files (50-500MB)**: Processing takes 5-30 minutes
- **Large files (over 500MB)**: Processing may take 30+ minutes

For best results, work with files under 500MB. Large files can be processed but will take significant time.

### Format Compatibility

Input formats supported:
- MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM
- FLV, WMV, MPEG, 3GP
- Most common video codecs (H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9, etc.)

### Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Opera

This tool uses the single-threaded version of FFmpeg.wasm, so no special server configuration is required.

## Troubleshooting

### Video Won't Load
- Ensure file is under 2GB
- Check that file is a valid video format
- Try using a different browser

### Processing Failed
- Video might use unsupported codec
- File might be corrupted
- Try converting to MP4 first as a baseline

### Browser Crashes or Freezes
- File is too large for available memory
- Close other tabs/applications
- Try processing on a device with more RAM

### Slow Processing
This is normal! WebAssembly FFmpeg is significantly slower than native desktop FFmpeg. For large files or frequent processing, consider using desktop FFmpeg instead.

## Technical Details

- **Library**: FFmpeg.wasm v0.12.10
- **Architecture**: Single-threaded WebAssembly
- **Memory Limit**: 2GB maximum file size
- **Storage**: Files processed in browser memory (no disk I/O)
- **Security**: Sandboxed iframe with script permissions only

## Alternative: Desktop FFmpeg

For production workflows or large files, consider installing FFmpeg on your desktop:

```bash
# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows (via Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Desktop FFmpeg is 20-50x faster and has no file size limits, but requires command-line knowledge. This browser tool is perfect for occasional use, learning, or when you need quick conversions without installing software.
