# Time Block Planner

I used [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) my preferred AI coding assistant.

A minimalist time blocking tool that lets you visually plan
your day in 15-minute increments. Features a brutalist
black-and-white design with intuitive drag-and-drop controls.

## Overview

Time Block Planner helps you organize your day by creating visual blocks of time for different activities. The interface is clean, simple, and focused on helping you plan without distraction.

## How to Use

### Creating Time Blocks

1. **Click and drag** on the timeline to create a new time block
2. **Enter a label** for your activity (e.g., "MEETING", "WORK", "BREAK")
3. **Adjust times** if needed using the time inputs
4. **Save** to add the block to your schedule

### Editing Time Blocks

- **Click** on any block to edit its label and times
- **Drag the top or bottom edges** to resize blocks
- **Click and drag** the block itself to move it to a different time
- **Click the × button** to delete a block
- **Right-click** for quick delete

### Quick Actions

- Use the quick label buttons (**MEETING**, **WORK**, **BREAK**) for faster entry
- Press **ESC** to cancel editing
- **Shift-click** on a block to edit without delay
- **Double-click** to always edit, even small blocks

### Exporting Your Schedule

Export your time blocks in two formats:

- **Markdown** - Clean, readable format perfect for notes
- **JSON** - Structured data with times in both formatted and minute values
